# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Overview

This project provides an exploratory analysis of electric vehicle data using Python. The analysis leverages popular data science libraries to clean, explore, and visualize the data, ultimately uncovering trends in performance metrics, market adoption, and energy efficiency.

## Dataset

The notebook analyzes a dataset containing various features of electric vehicles. The dataset may include details such as:
- Vehicle model and specifications
- Battery capacity and range
- Charging times and efficiency metrics
- Price and technical characteristics

*Note: Adjust the dataset description as needed based on your actual data source.*

## Analysis and Features

The Jupyter Notebook, `Electric_Vehicle_Data_Analysis_Python.ipynb`, covers the following key aspects:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Visualization:** Creating plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight trends and patterns in electric vehicle performance.
- **Insights Generation:** Identifying key trends, such as performance variations, efficiency comparisons, and market trends that can inform further research or business decisions.
